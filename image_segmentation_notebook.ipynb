    "1. What is Image Segmentation?\n",
    "In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments. The goal of segmenting an image is to\n",
    "change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. It is usually used for locating objects and\n",
    "creating boundaries.  \n",
    "For example: Let’s take a problem where the picture has to be provided as input for object detection. Rather than processing the whole image,\n",
    "the detector can be inputted with a region selected by a segmentation algorithm. This will prevent the detector from processing the whole\n",
    "image thereby reducing inference time.\n",

    "1. Threshold Based Segmentation\n",
    "Image thresholding segmentation is a simple form of image segmentation. It is a way to create a binary or multi-color image based on setting\n",
    "a threshold value on the pixel intensity of the original image. In this thresholding process, we will consider the intensity histogram of all the\n",
    "pixels in the image. Then we will set a threshold to divide the image into sections. For example, considering image pixels ranging from 0 to 255,\n",
    "we set a threshold of 60. So all the pixels with values less than or equal to 60 will be provided with a value of 0(black) and all the pixels with a\n",
    "value greater than 60 will be provided with a value of 255(white).\n",
    "Various thresholding techniques are :\n",
    "1. Global thresholding:  \n",
    "In this method, we use a bimodal image. A bimodal image is an image with 2 peaks of intensities in the intensity distribution plot. One for\n",
    "the object and one for the background. Then we deduce the threshold value for the entire image and use that global threshold for the\n",
    "whole image.\n",

    "In global thresholding, we had used an arbitrary value for threshold value and it remains a constant. A simpler but rather inept method is\n",
    "to trial and see the error.According to Otsu binarization, for that image, we can approximately take a value in the middle of those peaks as\n",
    "the threshold value. So in simply put, it automatically calculates a threshold value from image histogram for a bimodal image.\n",
    "2. Adaptive Thresholding \n",
    "A global value as threshold value may not be good in all the conditions where an image has different background and foreground lighting\n",
    "conditions in different actionable areas. We need an adaptive approach that can change the threshold for various components of the\n",
    "image. In this, the algorithm divides the image into various smaller portions and calculates the threshold for those portions of the image.\n",
